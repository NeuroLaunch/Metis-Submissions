# Week 1 - Project Benson
# Optimizing Volunteer Placement Around NYC Subway Stations

## _Team Turnstile Hoppers_. :  Gretta, Shweta, Alex, Steve
### _Start Date: September 24, 2018_ &emsp; _Due Date: October 01, 2018_

This was a team project designed to introduce the students to exploring a real world data set, develop knowledge about the Python ```pandas``` data-handling and ```matplotlib``` plotting modules, and foster good communication and work habits within a group. Each 4-student team was tasked with helping a hypothetical non-profit organization, Women Tech Women Yes, optimize the placement of their volunteers at subway stations around New York City by analyzing turnstile counter data.
 
The elements of this project are:  
1. Four Jupyter notebooks, written by the respective team members but attributed to the team as a whole: [Turnstile Score](Benson_pt1_TurnstileScore.ipynb), [Tech Score](Benson_pt2_TechScore.ipynb), [Census Score](Benson_pt3_CensusScore.ipynb), [Walk Score](Benson_pt4_WalkScore_FinalScore.ipynb). These notebooks include annotations and graphical output documenting the analyses, and describe the specific data sets and tools utilized.
2. The [project summary](Project1_Summary.pdf).

The New York City subway turnstile data can be found at the [MTA website](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). A list of geographical coordinates and code names for the subway stations is [here](http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/Stations.csv). Other sources are listed in the summary document and respective notebooks.

In summary, we recommended five subway stations for locating the WTWY volunteers: Grand Central at 42nd St, World Trade Center at Cortlandt St, 34th St at Herald Sq., Union Square and 14th St, and Penn Station at 34th St. For future analysis, we suggested a weighting scheme to refine how the four scores were combined to achieve the final score, a better way to report ridership numbers for stations with multiple entrances, inclusion of more technology companies and schools, and use of more granular demographic data from the Census tables.

_Did you know?_  This project was named for Olivia Benson, a lead detective in the hit TV show "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit".
