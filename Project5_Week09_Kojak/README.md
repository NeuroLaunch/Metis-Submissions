# Weeks 9 - 12: Project Kojak
# Automated Speaker Recognition

### _Start Date: November 25, 2018_ &emsp; _Due Date: December 12, 2018_

The final "passion" project, for which I delve into the mysteries of acoustics and human hearing.

The elements for this project are:  
1. The main Jupyter Notebook, [ClassOptimization](ClassOptimization.ipynb) which implements the full-scale model.
2. The function definitions found in [Speech_Analysis.py](Speech_Analysis.py).
3. The original [project proposal](Project5_Proposal.pdf).
4. The [project summary](Project5_Summary.pdf)
5. A [Power Point presentation](Project5_Presentation.pdf) on the project. There's also a [Keynote version](Project5_Presentation.key).

_Did you know?_  This project was named for Theo Kojak, the iconic (and bald) detective from 70s TV.
