# Weeks 2 and 3: Project Luther
# Low-budget Movies at the Box Office

### _Start Date: October 01, 2018_ &emsp; _Due Date: October 15, 2018_

This was the first individual project for the boot camp, centered on development of a linear regression model.  I chose to examine box office sales data for movies using data from the Internet Movie Database ([IMDb.com](https://www.imdb.com/search/title)).

The elements of the project are:  
1. A Jupyter Notebook, [IMDb_Regression](IMDb_Regression.ipynb), detailing the data handling and modeling steps.
2. A Python module defining functions for scraping film data, [IMDbSuite.py](IMDbSuite.py).
3. The original [project proposal](Project2_Proposal.pdf).
4. The [project summary](Project2_Summary.pdf) detailing the approach and results.
5. A [Power Point presentation](Project2_Presentation.pptx), also available in [pdf format](Project2_Presentation.pdf).

Ultimately, the prediction of high-budget movie box office receipts was fairly good, mainly on the basis of budget size itself. Low-budget movies, on the otherhand, were not easily predicted. Adjusting my time-series analysis to account for competition from low-budget movies released around the same time, especially those within the same film genre, might improve the prediction of box office success for these films.

_Did you know?_  This project was named for John Luther, the main character of the British crime drama 'Luther'.
