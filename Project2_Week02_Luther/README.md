# Weeks 2 and 3: Project Luther
## Linear Regression with a Movie Data Set

_Start Date: October 01, 2018_ &emsp; _Due Date: October 15, 2018_

This was the first individual project for the boot camp, centered on development of a linear regression model.  I chose to examine box office sales data for movies using data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com).

Different elements of the project are:  
1. A Jupyter Notebook, [Luther_IMDbRegression](/Luther_IMDbRegression.ipynb) detailing the data handling and modeling steps.
2. The notebook calls functions for scraping film data from a purpose-built module, [IMDbSuite.py](/IMDbSuite.py).
3. The original [project proposal](/Project2_Proposal.pdf).
4. The [project summary](/Project2_Summary.pdf)
5. A [Power Point presentation](/Project2_Presentation.pptx) on the project.




_Did you know?_  This project was named for John Luther, the main character of the British crime drama 'Luther'.
