# Week 1 - Project Luther
## Movie database analysis !!

_Start Date: September 24, 2018_ &emsp; _Due Date: October 01, 2018_

First individual project ... etc... edit this at project completion.

I took the following approach with the data analysis:
1. Decided to use IMDB...


The repository Python code for these analytical steps can be found within the following Jupyter notebooks: [File File]('Fake_link.ipynb')

The final results of the project are described in [Benson Project Presentation.pdf](Project1_Week01_Benson/Benson Project Presentation.pdf). In summary, we recommended five subway stations for placing WTWY volunteers: Grand Central at 42nd St, World Trade Center at Cortlandt St, 34th St at Herald Sq., Union Square and 14th St, and Penn Station at 34th St.

For future analysis, who knows...


_Did you know?_  This project was named for John Luther, the main character of the British crime drama 'Luther'.
