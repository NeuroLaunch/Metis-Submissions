## Metis Data Science Projects

This is my offical repository for project submissions for the Metis Seattle Fall 2018 Data Science Boot Camp. Projects are organized in their own folders labeled by the week number when the project began and the nickname for the project (e.g. "Project1_Week01_Benson/". A description about each project is given in the associated README.md document. Additionally, coding challenges related to the projects can be found in the [Challenges](Challenges/) folder.

I hope to write in more depth about some of these projects in my blog at Medium.com. Stay tuned.

### Project List

[Week 1:  Benson (_Sep 24, 2018_)](Project1_Week01_Benson/) - __Exploration and manipulation of a large data set__
- The objective of this team project was to optimize the placement of volunteers around city subway stations. The mandatory data set consisted of weekly subway turnstile counter values, but my team incorporated a variety of other factors into account as well. The web scraping experience came in handy for the next project.
    
[Weeks 2-3:  Luther (_Oct 12, 2018_)](Project2_Week02_Luther/) - __Data scraping and linear regression modeling__
- I created a linear regression model to predict the box office receipts of low budget movies, defined as costing less than $5 million. The data was obtained from IMDB.com.

[Weeks 4-6:  McNulty (_Oct 31, 2018_)](Project3_Week04_McNulty/) - __Supervised classification__
- Witness as I successfully discriminate labeled terrain types (crop, vegetation stubble, dirt) from satellite images, and adjust the classifier output based on cost-benefit considerations.

[Weeks 7-9:  Fletcher (_Nov 16, 2018_)](Project4_Week07_Fletcher/) - __Undervised clustering and natural langauge processing__
- In this project, I attempted to classify news articles based on whether they were 1) relevant to the U.S. economy; and 2) expressed positive or negative sentiment about the economy.

[Weeks 9-12:  Kojak (_Dec 11, 2018_)](Project5_Week09_Kojak/) - __Speaker recognition__
- For the final "passion" project" of the data science course, I trained a classifier to identify a person from the characteristics of their voice, using recorded audio as the input. A key component of this work was the simulation of 100 groups of male and female speakers, with each group representing a household's interactive audio device (i.e. a "smart speaker", like an Amazon Echo or Google Home).
