## Metis Data Science Projects

This is my offical repository for project submissions for the Metis Seattle Fall 2018 Data Science Boot Camp. Projects are organized in their own folders labeled by the week number when the project began and the nickname for the project (e.g. "Project1_Week01_Benson/". A description about each project is given in the associated README.md document. Additionally, coding challenges associated with some of the projects can be found in the [Challenges](Challenges/) folder.

The Metis projects were started and completed in very short time periods, effectively ranging from 3 days (Project 1) to about 15 days (Project 5). This was while participating in 4-6 hours of daily lectures and coding challenges. (Not a small feat, especially for a single dad of an elementary school student, but it was overall an incredibly productive learning experience.)

Occasional updates to my projects, from refining algorithms to creating dashboards and other visuals, can also be found here.

### Project List

[Week 1:  Benson (_Sep 24, 2018_)](Project1_Week01_Benson/) - __Exploration and manipulation of a large data set__
- The objective of this team project was to optimize the placement of volunteers around city subway stations. The data set consisted of weekly subway turnstile counter values, but my team incorporated a variety of other factors as well. The web scraping experience came in handy for the next project.
    
[Weeks 2-3:  Luther (_Oct 12, 2018_)](Project2_Week02_Luther/) - __Data scraping and linear regression modeling__
- I created a linear regression model to predict the box office receipts of low budget movies, defined as costing less than "$5 million. The data was scraped from the IMDB.com (Internet Movie Database) website.

[Weeks 4-6:  McNulty (_Oct 31, 2018_)](Project3_Week04_McNulty/) - __Supervised classification__
- Witness as I successfully discriminate labeled terrain types (crop, vegetation stubble, dirt) from satellite images, and adjust the classifier output based on cost-benefit considerations.

[Weeks 7-9:  Fletcher (_Nov 16, 2018_)](Project4_Week07_Fletcher/) - __Unsupervised clustering and natural language processing__
- In this project, I classified news articles based on whether they were 1) relevant to the U.S. economy; and 2) expressed positive or negative sentiment about the economy. The core of my approach was topic modeling via latent dirichlet allocation (LDA).

[Weeks 9-12:  Kojak (_Dec 11, 2018_)](Project5_Week09_Kojak/) - __Automated speaker recognition__
- For the final "passion" project of the data science course, I trained a classifier to identify a person from the characteristics of their voice, using recorded audio as the input. A key aspect of the project was the simulation of 100 groups of male and female speakers, with each group representing a single household's interactive audio device (i.e. a "smart speaker", like an Amazon Echo or Google Home). The algorithm resulted in over 80% speaker identification based on just a few seconds of speech, even while rejecting speakers outside of the trained group.
