# Steven Bierer's Project Submissions for Metis

This is my offical repository for submitting projects for the Metis Seattle Fall 2018 Data Science Boot Camp. Projects are organized in their own folders labeled by the week number when the project began and the nickname for the project (e.g. "Project1_Week01_Benson/". A description about each project is given in the associated README.md document.

Coding challenges related to the projects can also be found in this repository.

I will be writing about these projects, and about my experiences in the Metis Data Science course in general, at my GitHub blog. So please, follow along - [It's here and it's live!](https://neurolaunch.github.io/)


## Project List

* [Week 1:  Benson (_Sept 24, 2018_)](Project1_Week01_Benson/) - Exploration and manipulation of data sets
    - The objective was to optimize the placement of volunteers around city subway stations. We primary data set indicated weekly subway turnstile counter values, but we took a variety of other factors into account as well.
    
* [Week 2:  Luther ()]((Project1_Week02_Luther/) - Data scraping and linear regression modeling
    - I'm still in the process of deciding what kind of data to analyze. I'm leaning toward movie data gleaned from The Cube.. no I mean from IMDB or similar sites.
